# About BoaT

BoaT has been built using [GenomeHubs](https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs) to present [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org) results and related analyses run as part of the [BlobToolKit](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org) pipeline for Eukaryotic genome assemblies across the tree of life.

BoaT has been presented at [Biodiversity Genomics 2023](https://events.venue-av.com/e/BG23_registration). See the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X6dM2fo5OzyYufJSHReVx8hk39slMCl4nOGrsVskGtw/edit?usp=sharing).
