::breadcrumbs[Templates]

We have created search templates to make it easier to run some advanced searches, try out the example templates below to get started.

## Oxford plots

[Oxford plots](/templates/oxford) allow visualisation of synteny and rearrangements between pairs of genomes. Patterns in linkage group and gene order conservation differ across lineages and can help uncover genomic architecture evolution. [view templates...](/templates/oxford)

## Window-based statistics

[Window-based statistics](/templates/windows) show patterns in values of properties such as GC content along the length of chromosomes. These plots can be uesd to identify centromeric regions and can offer insight into large-scale chromosome patterning. [view templates...](/templates/windows)

## BUSCO counts

[BUSCO counts](/templates/counts) show patterns in assessments of genome completeness with assembly metrics and taxonomic group. This can highlight groups for which BUSCO completeness scores are consistently low. [view templates...](/templates/counts)
